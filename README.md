Provides syntax highlighting for **Crystal Lang** (currently in alpha).

## Language Support

The goal is to support every common situation and a handful of edgecases depending on how esoteric and difficult (or possible) to support with Nova's syntax highlighting rules. Right now this just supports crystal and some of the lower level types.

No plans at the moment for .ecr as the author doesn't uses it.

## Future plans

* Some common snippets.
* Macros
* All the "built-in" methods
